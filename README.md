Hi! My name is Suvir Bajaj and I'm a *Computer Science Engineering major* at UC Irvine. I'm currently developing my skills in React and Javascript to 
 gain an understanding of web app development. Some of my current projects are developing a dash GUI for UC Irvine's Electric Racecar Team *Anteater Electric Racing*.
 and creating web applications. Get in touch with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suvir-bajaj-750a90193/).
